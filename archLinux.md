# The Arch Way

## Simplicity

- Arch Linux defines simplicity as without unnecessary additions, modifications, or complications, and provides a lightweight UNIX-like base structure that allows an individual user to shape the system according to their own needs. In short: an elegant, minimalist approach.

- no cumbersome graphical configuration tools to hide possibilities from the user.

- Complexity without complication.

-- trying to hide the complexities of a system actually results in an even more complex system

## Code-correctness over convenience

## User-centric vs "User-Friendly"

## Openness

## Freedom

- By keeping the system simple, Arch Linux provides the freedom to make any choice about the system.

- "Arch Linux is what you make it." -- Judd Vinet

- Meta-Distribution
