# The Arch Way

## Simplicity

## Code-correctness over convenience

## User-centric vs "User-Friendly"

## Openness

## Freedom



# do-it-yourself


# Rolling Release


# BSD _like_ init system


# Who should _NOT_ use Arch?

- after reading The Arch Way, you disagree with the philosophy.

- you do not have the ability/time/desire for a 'do-it-yourself' GNU/Linux distribution.

- you require support for an architecture other than x86_64 or i686.

- you take a strong stand on using a distribution which only provides free software as defined by GNU.

- you believe an operating system should configure itself, run out of the box, and include a complete default set of software and desktop environment on the installation media.

- you do not want a bleeding edge, rolling release GNU/Linux distribution.

- you are happy with your current OS.

- you want an OS that targets a different userbase.
